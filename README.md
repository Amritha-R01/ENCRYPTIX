## üìÅ Projects

### 1. Game.py ‚Äì Rock, Paper, Scissors  
A terminal-based game where the user plays Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer. The computer randomly chooses a move, and the winner is decided based on standard rules.

A simple calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and other operations. The user inputs two numbers and selects an operation.
